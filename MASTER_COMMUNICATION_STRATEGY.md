## 🎯 STRATEGIC OVERVIEW

### Mission
Position RETEC as Ghana's leading career-curriculum mapping platform through authentic, value-first engagement with schools.

3. Build testimonials and PROOF
4. Scale through word-of-mouth

- Create proof points

**Phase 2: MOMENTUM** (Weeks 3-6)
- Launch pilot programs
- Collect testimonials
- Refine messaging

```

### When School Asks "How Much?"
```
"100% free right now. We're focused on helping Ghana's students, not charging schools."

```
"No catch! We're building market presence and getting feedback. Your insights help us improve. That's the exchange - free access for honest feedback."
```

### When School Says "Maybe Later"

```

## 🎯 WHEN TO EVOLVE STRATEGY

**Signs It's Time to Adjust:**

❌ Response rate <15% after 30 schools
❌ Demo show-up rate <50%
❌ No schools convert to active use after 10 demos
❌ Negative feedback pattern emerges

**What to Do:**
1. Review ALL conversations
2. Identify common objection/concern
3. Test new messaging
4. Get external feedback
5. Adjust and try again

**Remember:** Iteration is progress!
