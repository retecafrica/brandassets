## 🚨 IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES (Never Forget These)

### 1. Be Helpful, Not Sales-y
**Bad:** "Our revolutionary AI-powered platform will transform your school!"  
**Good:** "We map JHS subjects to careers so students see why they're learning. Want to see how it works?"

### 2. Ghana-Specific Always
**Bad:** "STEM career pathways"  
**Good:** "Which JHS Science topics matter for becoming a nurse in Ghana"

### 3. Demonstrate > Claim
**Bad:** "We're the best career platform"  
**Good:** "Try searching 'Teacher' - you'll see 13 relevant topics mapped"

### 4. Free = Say It Often
**Bad:** [Don't mention pricing]  
**Good:** "It's completely free for schools. No cost, no commitment."

### 5. Consistent Voice
Use BRAND_GUIDE.md voice guidelines for EVERY piece of communication
