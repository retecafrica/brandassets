## 🎤 IN-PERSON VISIT SCRIPTS

### Opening (First 60 Seconds)

```
Good [morning/afternoon], and thank you for your time.

Let me ask you something: How often do your students ask "Why do I need to learn this?"

[Let them respond]

That's exactly what RETEC addresses. 

We're not here to change your curriculum or add extra work. We're here to help students see the connection between what they're already learning and where they want to go.

Can I show you a quick example?

[Pull up platform on device]

Let's search for [career they mentioned students want]. Watch what happens...
```

---

### Core Pitch (5 Minutes)

```
Here's how RETEC works in three steps:

**Step 1: Career Search**
A student says "I want to be a [Teacher/Nurse/Entrepreneur]"

**Step 2: Relevance Revealed**  
RETEC instantly shows them:
• The top 3 most important subjects
• Specific topics within each subject
• Real Ghana examples of how it's used

**Step 3: Focused Learning**
Students now study strategically - still learning everything, but UNDERSTANDING why certain topics matter more for their path.

[Show live example on device]

See? This student interested in nursing can now see why fractions matter for medication dosing, why Chemistry matters for understanding drugs, why Math ratios matter for patient care.

It's all Ghana-specific. You see GHS currency, local examples, our job market realities.

What questions do you have?
```

---

### Handling Questions (Common Q&A)

**Q: "How much does it cost?"**
```
Right now, it's completely free. We're in our growth phase and focused on getting RETEC into as many schools as possible to help Ghana's students. Our goal is impact first, monetization later - if ever for schools.
```

**Q: "Who built this?"**
```
We're a Ghana-based team that saw the gap between what students learn and why they learn it. We combined GES curriculum mapping with real career requirements, using Ghana-specific examples throughout. It's built BY Ghanaians FOR Ghanaians.
```

**Q: "What if students choose the wrong career?"**
```
Great question! The beauty is they can search ANY career, anytime. If they change their mind from Teacher to Engineer, they just search again and adjust their focus. It's flexible. Plus, we show related careers so students discover options they hadn't considered.
```

**Q: "How is this different from regular career talks?"**
```
Career talks are great for inspiration, but they usually end with "Study hard in school." RETEC goes deeper: "If you want THIS career, prioritize THESE specific topics for THESE specific reasons." It connects the talk to the classroom.
```

**Q: "Will teachers need training?"**
```
No formal training needed. It's just a website - if you can use Google, you can use RETEC. We provide a simple one-page guide, but honestly, students figure it out in 2 minutes. Teachers can use it to pull examples for lessons or just share the link with students.
```

---

### Closing (Next Steps)

**Option A: They're Interested**
```
Wonderful! Here's what I suggest:

Let's do a pilot session with one class - maybe JHS 2 or 3. Takes just one period (40 minutes). Students explore the platform, we get their feedback, you see how they engage.

Would next week work? We can coordinate with your career guidance coordinator or any willing teacher.

After the pilot, if it's valuable, we share access with your whole school. If not, no hard feelings - we got valuable feedback.

What day works best?
```

**Option B: They're Hesitant**
```
I completely understand. This is new, and you need to be sure it's right for your students.

How about this: I'll send you a demo link so you can explore it yourself when you have 10 free minutes. No pressure, no follow-up unless you reach out.

If after trying it you think "This could help our students," we can talk next steps.

Fair enough?
```

**Option C: They're Not Interested**
```
I appreciate your honesty. Can I ask - is it the concept that doesn't fit, or is it just timing/bandwidth right now?

[If concept:] That's valuable feedback. What would make something like this MORE useful for you?

[If timing:] Totally understand. Can I check back in next term? Schools often have more capacity after exams settle.

Thanks for your time today - I learned a lot about what [School Name] needs.
```
