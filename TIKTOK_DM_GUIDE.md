## 💬 INITIAL DM SCRIPTS

### Option 1: Simple & Friendly (RECOMMENDED)
```
Hi! 👋 Thanks for following RETEC!

We're building Ghana's first platform that shows JHS students exactly which subjects connect to their career dreams.

For example: A student wants to be a nurse? They can see which Science and Math topics matter most + real Ghana examples.

Would you be interested in seeing how it works? Happy to share more! 😊
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Warm, not corporate
- ✅ Clear value in one sentence
- ✅ Concrete example
- ✅ Low-pressure ask

---

### Option 2: Problem-Focused
```
Hello! 🙌 

We noticed you followed RETEC - thanks!

Quick question: Do your students ever ask "Why do I need to learn this?"

We're working on something for JHS that connects every subject topic to real careers in Ghana. Teachers tell us it helps with the relevance challenge.

Would you like a quick demo of how it works?
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Starts with pain point
- ✅ Shows understanding of classroom reality
- ✅ Social proof (other teachers)
- ✅ Direct offer

---

### Option 3: Curiosity Hook
```
Hi there! 👋

Thanks for the follow! We're curious - what made you check out RETEC?

We're mapping JHS curriculum to careers so students can see "Oh, THIS is why I need fractions for being a chef" or "THAT's why electricians need Physics."

Happy to show you around the platform if you're interested! 🎓
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Engages them first
- ✅ Fun examples
- ✅ Not pushy
- ✅ Opens dialogue

---

### Option 4: Direct Value
```
Hello! 🎓

Saw you followed RETEC - welcome!

We're a free tool that helps JHS students (and teachers) see which curriculum topics matter most for different careers.

Example: Search "Entrepreneur" → See 15+ relevant topics from Math, Social Studies, ICT with Ghana-specific examples.

Want us to show you how your students could use it? No cost, no commitment. 😊
```

**Why this works:**
- ✅ "Free" removes barrier
- ✅ Concrete example
- ✅ Benefits both students AND teachers
- ✅ Clear "no strings" message

## 🔄 RESPONSE HANDLING GUIDE

### If They Reply: "What is this?"

**Your Response:**
```
Great question!

RETEC is like a map between JHS subjects and careers. 

Students pick a career they're interested in (Teacher, Nurse, Engineer, etc.) and we show them:
✅ Which subjects matter most
✅ Specific topics to focus on
✅ Real Ghana examples of how it's used

Makes learning feel more relevant. Want to try searching a career yourself? I can send you the link!
```

---

### If They Reply: "Is this free?"

**Your Response:**
```
Yes! 100% free right now. 

We're building this for Ghana's students and want as many schools as possible to benefit.

We're in growth phase so we're focused on getting feedback and improving - not charging. 

Would you like to see it in action?
```

---

### If They Reply: "How would this work for our school?"

**Your Response:**
```
There are 3 easy ways schools are using RETEC:

1️⃣ **Student self-exploration** - Share the link, students explore on their own during free time

2️⃣ **Teacher-guided sessions** - Use in career guidance periods or library time to show students connections

3️⃣ **Classroom examples** - Teachers pull real-world examples from RETEC for their lessons

No installation, no training, no cost.

Want to see a quick demo with your school's common career interests? (e.g., Teaching, Nursing, Entrepreneurship?)
```

---

### If They Reply: "Send more information"

**Your Response:**
```

```

---

### If They Reply: "Can we get a demo?"

**Your Response:**
```
Absolutely! 🎉

We can do either:

📱 **Quick virtual tour** (15 min on WhatsApp/Zoom) - I walk you through common careers your students choose

🏫 **In-person visit** (if you're in [YOUR REGION]) - Show teachers/admin team

OR

🎓 **Pilot session** - Try it with one class, get student feedback

What works best for your schedule?
```

---

### If They Don't Reply After 48 Hours

**Follow-Up Message (Send 3 days after initial DM):**

**Option A: Value-Add**
```
Hi again! 👋

No pressure on the last message - I know school schedules are busy!

Just wanted to share: We just added 140 new career-subject connections. Now have deep coverage for careers like:
• Teacher (13 topics)
• Nurse (13 topics)  
• Software Developer (12 topics)
• Entrepreneur (15 topics)

If timing is better now, happy to show you! If not, no worries - we'll keep improving it for Ghana's students. 😊
```

**Option B: Soft Check-In**
```
Hey! Hope school term is going well.

Just checking - were you interested in seeing the RETEC platform or was it just a casual follow? 

Either way is totally fine! We're here if you ever want to explore it. 🎓
```

**Option C: Student Win Story**
```
Hi! Quick update:

We had a JHS 3 student message us yesterday saying RETEC helped him realize he needs to focus on Math ratios for his pharmacy goal. His exact words: "Now I know WHY I'm studying this!"

That's what we're building for. 

Still interested in checking it out for your students?

## 💡 CONVERSATION STARTERS (If They Engage)

### Ask Them:
1. "What careers do your students talk about most?"
2. "Do teachers struggle with the 'why do we need this?' question?"
3. "How do you currently handle career guidance?"
4. "What subjects do students find least relevant?"

**Why ask:** Shows you care about THEIR context, not just selling. Also gives you valuable market research.

## 📝 OBJECTION HANDLING

### "We already have career guidance"
**Response:** "That's great! RETEC isn't a replacement - it's a tool that connects your EXISTING career discussions to specific classroom topics. Think of it as the bridge between 'I want to be a nurse' and 'Here's why today's Science lesson matters for that goal.' We can complement what you're already doing."

### "Students don't have phones/internet"
**Response:** "Totally understand. Many schools use RETEC in computer labs or library periods on shared devices. Or teachers project it during career guidance sessions. It's a website, so any device works. We can explore what setup would work for your school."

### "Too busy to add new things"
**Response:** "We hear that a lot! The beauty of RETEC is it doesn't ADD work - it makes existing teaching more relevant. No installation, no training needed. Students can explore independently, or teachers can just pull examples from it. Want to see how low-effort it actually is?"

### "How do we know it's accurate?"
**Response:** "Great question! We mapped the official GES JHS curriculum to careers using Ghana-specific examples. Every connection includes real-world applications with GHS currency and local context. We're also continuously getting feedback from teachers to improve. Want to fact-check a few examples together?"
